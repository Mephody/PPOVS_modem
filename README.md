Course of laboratory projects.

I can't really comment on this project due its age, but if you have got some issues please contact with me in any social network =). 

This project was created as big labouratory project (4 little laboratory projects).
It contains followed laboratory projects:
1) Coder (1 and 2-d laboratory projects);
2) Decoder (the third laboratory project);
3) Detector(the fourth laboratory project).

The detector consists of two filters and a detecting part of the code.

You may find some comments in code and they'll help you to undestand it.
I didn't use circular buffer as sinuns generating algorithm.
